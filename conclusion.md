# Build Conclusion and Thoughts

Overall, I am very pleased with the build process.  It took about 24 hours to mechanically assemble, and then another 10 to 15 on the software setup.  The mechanical assembly manual was quite good and Siboor was responsive to feedback and corrections.  Once I got to the software side, I was mostly on my own and cobbling together information from the manuals from the respective parts which was a bit more daunting.  I'm hoping that the docs site that they're currently fleshing out will solve this issue for anyone in the future.  

This was my first Voron build and quite a good experience overall, it has definitely made me think about building another one (perhaps at 2.4 or a v0) as I'm already addicted to printing things 4 times faster than my Ender clone bedslingers.

As for the things in this kit over the stock BOM, I'm not sure the AWD is really neccessary, as I'm not sure I'm ever going to push this machine _that_ hard.  I do like the CNC bits, and I know that CNC is kind of a meme in the Voron community, but I appreciate that the parts under tension won't creep and are much stiffer. 

## Next steps

I've already got a list of things that I'm going to be adding on to the printer over the coming weeks/months:

* Panel snap latches
* Chamber Thermistor
* Webcam
* LED strips for chamber lighting
* [Xol](https://github.com/Armchair-Heavy-Industries/Xol-Toolhead) Toolhead
* [Tradrack](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/TradRack) for MMU
